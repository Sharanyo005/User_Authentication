# User Authentication using Python
This project uses txt files as a database to store usernames and password. At every run time, this program searches if there already exists an account for given username. If not, it suggests you to make you an account and to try logging in after that.


## Get Started

To run this prject, run the following command

```bash
  python index.py
```


## Contribution

Contributions are always welcome!
Any contributors with SQL knowledge, who can convert the txt database to SQL db, are preferred.
